                    Paw Detective is a pet detection system that utilizes Ultralytics and YOLOv8 to detect and classify
                    various pet breeds in images (instance segmentation level). This repository provides a complete
                    training pipeline, data processing utilities, and a Flask application for online interaction with
                    the trained model.
